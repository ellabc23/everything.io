	<h2>First of all, What is Everything.io?</h2> 
	<p>
Everything.io is a website where, well, everything is here! We have a world of knowledge and fun from books to Pusheen. There
are many different types of pages on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io/books.ht
ml"> Butterfly Books, </a> you read the given text and vote on the poll. In another type of page, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/everything.io/track.html">Log Your Account,</a> you become your own character and log your self-appointed username.
		However, if you submit your ideas to <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io
/choosenew.html">Choose New Pages,</a> your username and/or idea(s) might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
	
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully or harm other characters or other active patrons. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' You CAN put your character in danger, if you do not make it brutal or if your character is severely harmed. For example, even if your character is Maddie, 
	you can't write, 'Maddie turned around to escape, but came face to face with a giant! The giant lifted his foot and smashed her.' You CAN write, 'Maddie turned around 
	to escape, but came face to face with a giant! The giant grabbed her, but when he opened his hand, he only held a sack of flour. Maddie ran away, unharmed.' If things 
	get out of hand, the MOD, ellabc23, will decide what happens next, and if the patron should be punished, i.e. banned. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation and grammar. We all make mistakes, but it doesn't help if your sentence is something
like, 'the DOg ws verry trIed an sleeped alot latre.' instead of, 'The dog was very tired and slept for a long time later.'
It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuation and grammar. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Please do not spam in the chat. If you see any users spamming or using profanity, please report them on the Against Spam chat, or if you have my email, you 
		could contact me directly.</p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations. Whatever you write is said out loud in roleplays. Any actions you do are put in asteracts. For 
example, 'Going on a quest seems fun! *Kat grabs her potions and turns to Vanessa* Let's go! ' However, if you like quotations, go ahead. 
  Just make sure you tell the chat first.</p> 
<br>
<p> • If you're trying to virtually talk to one specific person, please put @ before the person's name. For example, 
if you're chatting with AudreythePotato, you would write @AudreythePotato. </p>
<br> 		
<p> • Be consistent with your online username in each forum. It gets confusing if you don't. (One username per chatroom please!) </p> 
<br>
	<h2> <p> • Have fun! </p> </center>
