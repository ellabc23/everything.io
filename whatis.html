<br>
	<h2>First of all, What is Everything.io?</h2> 
	<p>
Everything.io is a website where, well, . You can be a unicorn, robot, or even a magestic dragon. There
are two types of role play on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub/harrypotter.ht
ml"> A Harry Potter Adventure, </a> you follow the prewritten script. In the other type, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/thefantasyclub/townofdreams.html">The Town of Dreams,</a> you become your own character and can come up with your own
stories for the prechosen theme. However, if you submit your ideas to the <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/thefantasyclub
/choosethetheme.html">Choose the Theme</a> page, your username and/or idea might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
	
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully or harm other characters. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' If things get out of hand, the MOD, ellabc23, will decide what happens next. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation and grammar. We all make mistakes, but it doesn't help if your sentence is something
like, 'the Dgo ws verry trIed an selep alot latre.'
It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuation and grammar. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Please do not spam in the chat. If you see any users spamming or using profanity, please report them, or if you have </p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations. Whatever you write is said out loud. Any actions you do are put in asteracts. For 
example, 'I'm so bored. *Shelby lays on the sliver couch.* I'm going to go to sleep ' However, if you like quotations, go ahead. 
  Just make sure you tell the chat first.</p> 
<br>
<p> • If you're trying to virtually talk to one specific person, please put @ before the person's name. For example, 
if you're chatting with Mary the Elf, you would write @MarytheElf. </p>
<br> 		
<p> • Be consistent with your online username per forum. It gets confusing if you don't. </p> 
<br>
	<p> • Have fun! </p> </center>
