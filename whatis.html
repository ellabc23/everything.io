<br>
	<h2>First of all, What is Everything.io?</h2> 
	<p>
Everything.io is a website where, well, everything is here! We have everything from books to Pusheen. There
are many different types of pages on this site. In one type, like <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io/books.ht
ml"> Butterfly Books, </a> you read the given text and vote on the poll. In another type, such as <a href="https://ellabc23.
github.io/everything.io/track.html">Log Your Account,</a> you become your own character and log your self-appointed username.
		However, if you submit your ideas to <a href="https://ellabc23.github.io/everything.io
/choosenew.html">Choose New Pages,</a> your username and/or idea might be featured in a new roleplay world!
	
	
	
	
	
<h2>What are the Rules?</h2>
	
	<p> • While on chats, please don't overdo romance or cuss. Keep it PG.</p> 
<br>
<p> • Don't bully or harm other characters. For example, you can't write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John pushed
  her into the lava.' You CAN write, 'Lizzie turned around, ready to return home, when John saved her from falling in the lava in front
  of her.' If things get out of hand, the MOD, ellabc23, will decide what happens next. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Try to use proper punctuation and grammar. We all make mistakes, but it doesn't help if your sentence is something
like, 'the Dgo ws verry trIed an selep alot latre.' instead of, 'The dog was very tired and slept for a long time later.'
It's much easier to read a sentence with proper punctuation and grammar. </p> 
<br>
<p> • Please do not spam in the chat. If you see any users spamming or using profanity, please report them, or if you have my email, you 
		could contact me.</p> 
<br>
<p> • You don't have to use quotations. Whatever you write is said out loud in roleplays. Any actions you do are put in asteracts. For 
example, 'Going on a quest seems fun! *Kat grabs her potions and turns to Vanessa* Let's go! ' However, if you like quotations, go ahead. 
  Just make sure you tell the chat first.</p> 
<br>
<p> • If you're trying to virtually talk to one specific person, please put @ before the person's name. For example, 
if you're chatting with Audrey the Potato, you would write @AudreythePotato. </p>
<br> 		
<p> • Be consistent with your online username in each forum. It gets confusing if you don't. </p> 
<br>
	<h2> <p> • Have fun! </p> </center>
