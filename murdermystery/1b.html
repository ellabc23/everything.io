  <h1>Looking for clues</h1>
    <p>
    is always a tough business. What might look like an incriminating piece of evidence could just turn out to be somebody's trash they forgot about. The best time to search 
      around is always as soon as possible.

   You check your watch and see that it is nearly sunrise. Now would be prime time to interrogate suspects,
    who just woke up and are tired. Those are the ones who spill information, but they only stay in that mindset for so long. It would also be stratigic to hunt for clues,
      things the police missed when sweeping the town. If you wait too long, the criminal could potentially discover the evidence before you and cover their tracks.
