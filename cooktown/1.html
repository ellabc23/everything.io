 <p> In this story, you are Alexis, a young baker in need of a big break. You have to make the choices that influence Alexis's life,
  from which dog to adopt to which bakery you should buy. 
   <p>Will Alexis become a world wide famous chef, or will all of the big dreams
  burn down in flames?<p/>
  </center>
 <p>"Alexis, what have you gotten yourself into now?" Belle, your best friend asks. "Are you really going to start a career out of your
   little hobby? If this really happens, I can't promise to tell you what you want to hear. I'll tell you the truth."
