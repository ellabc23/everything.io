  <h2>The Misunderstanding </h2>

<h4>**Happy**</h4>

Gemma Snow looked at the smooth pendant in her hands and felt confident.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her delicious surroundings. She had always loved beautiful Syrup City with its wandering,
whispering waffles. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel confident.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Boris Blackman. Boris was a cowardly monster with feathery 
fingers and beautiful elbows.

Gemma gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a bold, selfish, lemonade drinker with thin fingers and wobbly elbows. 
Her friends saw her as an adorable, carefree, angel. Once, she had even brought a late puppy back from the brink of death.

But not even a bold person who was loved by all was prepared for what Boris had in store
today.

The hail pounded like shrieking bears, making Gemma delusional.

As Gemma stepped outside and Boris came closer, she could see the mischievious glint in his eyes.

Boris glared with all the wrath of 1000 wolves. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you. Give it back!"

Gemma looked back, even more cross and still fingering the smooth pendant. "Boris, you know what happened," she replied cooly.

They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two steady, smiling snakes skipping at a very hopeful vacation, which had pop 
music playing in the background and two admirable uncles running to the beat. "Fine. I forgive you." And they went inside for a glass of 
  lemonade.

<h2>The Tale of Andrew Blackman </h2>
<p>
<h4>**Scary**</h4>
<p>
     Andrew Blackman looked at the solid torch in his hands and felt sad.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his destroyed surroundings. He had always hated boring Future City with its regurgitated, rich rubbish. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel sad.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Katy Cox. Katy was a sinister monster with greasy eyes and dirty ankles.

Andrew gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a bold, selfish, tea drinker with sticky eyes and sloppy ankles. His friends saw him as a vigilant, vigorous volcano. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a miniature kitten.

But not even a bold person who had once made a cup of tea for a miniature kitten, was prepared for what Katy had in store today.

The rain hammered like screaming lizards, making Andrew cross.

As Andrew stepped outside and Katy came closer, he could see the ice-dancing glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want revenge," Katy bellowed, in a smart tone. She slammed her fist against Andrew's chest, with the force of 1819 maggots. "I frigging hate you, Andrew Blackman."

Andrew looked back, even more cross and still fingering the solid torch. "Katy, get out. Now," he replied.

They looked at each other with lonely feelings, like two shaky, slobbering snakes escaping at a very violent funeral, which had metal music playing in the background and two peculiar uncles hiding to the beat.

Suddenly, Katy lunged forward and tried to punch Andrew in the face. Quickly, Andrew grabbed the solid torch and brought it down on Katy's skull.

Katy's greasy eyes trembled and her dirty ankles wobbled. She looked afraid, her body raw like a repulsive, ripe record.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Katy Cox was dead.

Andrew Blackman went back inside and made himself a nice cup of tea.
