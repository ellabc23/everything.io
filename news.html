Gemma Snow looked at the smooth pendant in her hands and felt confident.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her delicious surroundings. She had always loved beautiful Syrup City with its wandering,
whispering waffles. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel confident.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Boris Blackman. Boris was a cowardly monster with feathery 
fingers and beautiful elbows.

Gemma gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a bold, selfish, lemonade drinker with thin fingers and wobbly elbows. 
Her friends saw her as an adorable, carefree, angel. Once, she had even brought a late puppy back from the brink of death.

But not even a bold person who was loved by all was prepared for what Boris had in store
today.

The hail pounded like shrieking bears, making Gemma delusional.

As Gemma stepped outside and Boris came closer, she could see the mischievious glint in his eyes.

Boris glared with all the wrath of 1000 wolves. He said, in hushed tones, "I hate you. Give it back!"

Gemma looked back, even more cross and still fingering the smooth pendant. "Boris, you know what happened," she replied cooly.

They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two steady, smiling snakes skipping at a very hopeful vacation, which had pop 
music playing in the background and two admirable uncles running to the beat.

Gemma regarded Boris's feathery fingers and beautiful elbows. "I feel the same way!" revealed Gemma with a delighted grin.

Boris looked sparkly, his emotions blushing like a pongy, purring piano.

Then Boris came inside for a nice drink of lemonade.
