         •Always do the daily reward. It is located in the news section of the game. Then, you press on the cat right of the password and
         enter it where it asks for it. You will recieve a small amount of silver and sometimes gold fish. Every five days that you enter
         the password, you will earn a Ritzy Bitz can for free!
