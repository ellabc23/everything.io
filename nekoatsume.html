   Neko Atsume is a cute cat collecting game where you use silver and gold fish to buy goodies and food for your cats. This page will be
   my blog of some sorts with little tips and tricks.

      <h2>Useful Tips For Beginners</h2>
      <p>
         <b>
         ‚Ä¢Always do the daily reward. It is located in the news section of the game. Then, you press on the cat right of the password and
         enter it where it asks for it. You will recieve a small amount of silver and sometimes gold fish. Every five days that you enter
         the password, you will earn a Ritzy Bitz can for free!
         <p>
            ‚Ä¢Stock up on Frisky Bitz. This food may be 30 silver fish, but it is definitly worth it. The cats pay you back and, depending 
            on the goodies you have out, you might even gain fish.
            <p>
               ‚Ä¢ Save all of your gold fish for the yard extention, which is key. It costs 180 gold fish and unlocks five new goodies
               and a whole food bowl for your kitties to enjoy! The Cat Metropolis is also important. It costs 50 gold fish and takes up two
               spots, but can hold up to 6 cats at a time.
